JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is the Java API that manages connecting to a database, issuing queries and commands, and handling result sets obtained from the database.
The steps for connecting to a database with JDBC are as follows:

Install or locate the database you want to access.(sqlite3)
Include the JDBC library.(JAR FILE sqlite-jdbc-3.30.1)
Ensure the JDBC driver you need is on your classpath.("jdbc:sqlite:C://sqlite//univ.db")
Use the JDBC library to obtain a connection to the database.
Use the connection to issue SQL commands.
Close the connection when you're finished.
